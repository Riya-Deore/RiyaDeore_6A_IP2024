<h2>India's Contribution to Satellite Technology - NAVIC</h2>
<p>India's Contribution to NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation)
NAVIC is an Indian satellite navigation system created by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). It's India's version of GPS, which helps people find their location on Earth using signals from satellites.</p> 
<h3>1. Launching Satellites</h3>
<p>•	To make NAVIC work, ISRO built satellites that orbit the Earth. These satellites send signals to devices like smartphones and cars to tell you exactly where you are.
•	India launched 7 satellites into space for NAVIC, which send location information to the ground.</p>
<h3>2. Accuracy and Coverage</h3>
<p>•	NAVIC is super accurate in India and nearby areas. It can tell your position very precisely, better than many other systems like GPS in India.
•	It covers India and the surrounding countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<h3>3. Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>•	Before NAVIC, India used GPS from other countries like the USA. But with NAVIC, India became independent and didn’t need to depend on other countries for navigation.
•	This was a big achievement because now India controls its own satellite system.</p>
<h3>4. Helping in Daily Life</h3>
<p>•	NAVIC helps people in India navigate, find directions, and even helps with things like public transport and disaster rescue operations.
•	It also makes travel safer for trains, planes, and ships in India.</p>
<h3>5. Boosting India's Defense</h3>
<p>•	NAVIC is also used by the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force to help them with navigation during missions.
•	It gives India an extra level of security because we can rely on our own system for defense.</p>
<h3>6. Science and Technology</h3>
<p>•	NAVIC is also a great example of India's science and technology skills. Indian scientists built, launched, and now manage the satellites.
•	It helps scientists in India study the Earth and space by providing useful data.</p>
