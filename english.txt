<p>Who is Ila Sachani? 

Ila Sachani is a talented Kathiawar embroidery artist. She overcame physical challenges to excel in her craft.  
She learned embroidery using her feet under the guidance of her mother and grandmother. 
Ila was born with a deformity that rendered her arms useless. So, she taught her feet the art of making fine patterns in traditional embroidery.

Ila Sachani’s Journey:

Ila’s journey began in Amreli, Gujarat, where she was born into a farming family. Ila was born with her hands hanging loose by her sides. 
She could not use her hands like the other children. Ila’s mother and grandmother supported her to overcome her challenge. 
They both were skilled in the art of Kathiawar embroidery and wanted to encourage Ila to do this art. 
They taught her to make many stunning patterns with the help of her feet. Her brother and sister helped her too. 
Ila did not give up on this task even when it was hard and soon became an expert at it at a young age. 
She started to learn many styles even other than Gujarati like Kacchi, Kashmiri, Lucknawi, and more.

How did Ila become popular?

In the beginning, Ila crafted designs only for her friends and family who were amozed by her talent. They talked about those crafts to others. In a little while, the people in the village also discovered her skill and the praise for her work began to spread.

Acheivements-

Ila received multiple awards, including national recognition, for her skill in embroidery. She was honored with the prestigious President’s Medal, highlighting her talent and determination.
