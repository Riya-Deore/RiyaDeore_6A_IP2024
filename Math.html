<h1 align = "center"> About Aryabhata</h1>
<p>Aryabhata was a famous ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer who lived during 476–550 CE. He is often known as one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists in history. He is best known for his work in the fields of mathematics and astronomy, making significant contributions that influenced later developments in both areas.</p>
<h3>Mathematics:</h3>
<p>•	Aryabhata made important contributions to the understanding of numbers and their properties. He is well known for giving an approximation for π (pi), stating that it is roughly 3.1416.</p>
<p>•	He also worked on algebra and was one of the first to describe the concepts of zero and place value.</p>
<h3>Astronomy:</h3>
<p>•	Aryabhata proposed that the Earth is spherical and rotates on its axis, which was a revolutionary idea for that time.</p>
<p>•	He also explained the cause of lunar and solar eclipses and understood that they were not caused by the shadow of the Earth or other celestial bodies but by the alignment of planets and the Moon.</p>
<p>•	His work on the motion of planets was ahead of its time, and he provided methods to calculate the positions of celestial bodies.</p>
