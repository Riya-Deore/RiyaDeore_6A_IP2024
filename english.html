<h3>Who is Ila Sachani? </h3>

<p>Ila Sachani is a talented Kathiawar embroidery artist. She overcame physical challenges to excel in her craft.  
She learned embroidery using her feet under the guidance of her mother and grandmother.

<h3>Ila Sachani’s Journey:</h3>

<p>Ila’s journey began in Amreli, Gujarat, where she was born into a farming family. Ila was born with her hands hanging loose by her sides.

They both were skilled in the art of Kathiawar embroidery and wanted to encourage Ila to do this art. 
They taught her to make many stunning patterns with the help of her feet. Her brother and sister helped her too. 
Ila did not give up on this task even when it was hard and soon became an expert at it at a young age. 
She started to learn many styles even other than Gujarati like Kacchi, Kashmiri, Lucknawi, and more.</p>
